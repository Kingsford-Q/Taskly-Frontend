This is the frontend of Taskly, a web-based task management application built to help users stay productive by organizing and tracking their tasks easily.

The current version of the frontend focuses on the authentication system, allowing users to register and log in securely. The interface is built with simplicity and ease of use in mind, providing a clean layout and smooth navigation between pages.

Built using modern web technologies like Vite (React and Tailwind CSS), the app is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile views. It communicates with the backend through API requests to handle user login and registration, and it's structured in a way that makes it easy to scale as new features like task creation, deadlines, and reminders are added.

As development continues, the frontend will evolve to include a full dashboard for task management, filters, priority settings, and more, providing a complete productivity solution for users.
